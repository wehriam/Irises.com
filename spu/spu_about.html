<tr><td>



<p>
 Spuria irises are beardless irises which bloom towards the end of the spring Tall
Bearded Iris blooming season and help to extend the progression of bloom
in the perennial garden. </p>
<p>
Among the desirable attributes of Spuria Irises is the survival time of the cut flowers.
</p>
<p>
The blossums are also smaller than those of Bearded Irises supported on strong stems.
The smaller size of the individual blooms means that a spring rainstorm does not
injure the flowers. 
</p>
<p>
Spuria flowers are striking in form with proportionally tall relatively slender
standards and falls that extend outward on a relatively narrow petal but may
have a sudden downturn where the petal boadens into a wider oval shape. They
delight the eye by presenting a different form from a variety of different
viewpoints.</p>


<p> Colors range from white through yellows to  deep bronzy purples. They often
show interesting reticular patterns on the petals. Cultivars with blossums with
interesting color combinations are available in addition to self colored cultivars.</p>
