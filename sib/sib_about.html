<h1 align=center>  About Siberian Irises </h1>




<p>
 Siberian irises are beardless irises which bloom at the end of the spring Tall
Bearded Iris blooming season and help to extend the progression of bloom
in the perennial garden. They have slim upright attractive foliage which
retains its vertical form long after bloom season. They continue adding form and
texture into the first fall frosts when the foliage turns a reddish brown.
Some of them do rebloom. This is discussed in the individual descriptions.
</p>

<p>
 Bloom season here in Monkton, Northern Baltimore Co, Maryland starts in mid to late May & often extends into
July. The flowers appear en masse at the top of the foliage and give the
appearance of floating over the garden.
</p>
<p>
Among the desirable attributes of Siberian Irises is the durability of their
blossoms.  Flowers are small & delicate supported on strong stems.
The smaller size of the individual blooms means that a spring rainstorm does not
injure the flowers. In addition mature clumps send up many bloom stalks which
give a lovely massed effect when seen from a distance.

</p>
<p>
 Colors range from
white through blues to violets & deep purples into violet pinks & yellows. There are a
number of cultivars with multiple falls which look like miniature Japanese
Iris. They make wonderful cut flowers. Siberians are strong hardy plants that
thrive in spite of severe winters & even ice storms. When first planted they
need to be well watered but once established, they survive drought conditions
well.

In contrast to the Bearded Irises which are harmed by mulching, Siberian Irises
should be mulched with pine needles.
